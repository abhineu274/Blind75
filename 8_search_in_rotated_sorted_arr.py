There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 5000
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
All values of nums are unique.
nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
-104 <= target <= 104



Logic : In a rotated array, at least one part (left or right) is always sorted.
Just check whether mid is in left or right sorted half and then check if target is in that half.
Otherwise go to the other half.



class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        start, end = 0, len(nums) - 1
        
        while start <= end:
            mid = (start + end) // 2
            # Check if mid is the target
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            
            # Determine the sorted half
            if nums[start] <= nums[mid]:  # Left half is sorted
                if nums[start] <= target < nums[mid]:  # Target in the left half
                    end = mid - 1
                else:  # Target in the right half
                    start = mid + 1
            else:  # Right half is sorted
                if nums[mid] < target <= nums[end]:  # Target in the right half
                    start = mid + 1
                else:  # Target in the left half
                    end = mid - 1
        
        return -1  # Target not found
